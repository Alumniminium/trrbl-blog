# Micro Plans
Micro plans **share the same public IP** so you will only have **access to a random port range**, if you would like certain ports to be available to you, please tell me before ordering and I'll check if they're available.
Micro plans also** share the same CPU Cores.** You have **no dedicated CPU time** on those plans, so if half of the other clients decide to run an expensive script at 3pm, you will notice a slowdown at 3pm. That being said, at this point in time, even those plans are** faster than what other providers offer** on their completely oversold servers.
