# Micro Plans
Micro plans **share the same public IP** so you will only have **access to a random port range**, if you would like certain ports to be available to you, please tell me before ordering and I'll check if they're available.
Micro plans also **share the same CPU Cores.** You have **no dedicated CPU time** on those plans, so if half of the other clients decide to run an expensive script at 3pm, you will notice a slowdown at 3pm. That being said, at this point in time, even those plans are **faster than what other providers offer** on their completely oversold servers.

# How do I order?!

<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1rem; clear: right"><iframe src="https://discordapp.com/widget?id=599543436865044513&theme=dark" width="400" height="400" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
Currently, this is my first server in a datacenter, so I have not set up any automated order/deployment solution.
<a href="mailto:trrbl@her.st" alt="write me a mail">Email Me</a> what you want & your paypal email and I'll send your credentials with the billing agreement.
You can also message me on <a href="https://discord.gg/V2SyvrU" alt="discord invite">discord</a>.

I'm aware that this is a weird way to order in 2019, but that's how I keep my prices down :) 
I have no licensing fees to pay :)
